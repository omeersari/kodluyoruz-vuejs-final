## Project Summary

All the required objects are completed. You can add books, delete them if they are in the store
(with an alert) and also see if a book is set to a user. If a user has it, it can't be deleted in the book list.
In set user, available books are filtered in dropdown and with the required inputs, books can be set to a user. 
In get user, available books are filtered in dropdown and after selecting the book,
information of the user and get button are displayed. There is also a search input to search books
or authors. The same operations in the book list are also be seen after search result.
